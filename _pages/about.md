Hi, and welcome to my personal page. I'm a junior at Cornell University studying computer science, with an external specialization in chemistry and a side interest in anything STEM.

I'm an ex-NASA intern, having working on analyzing proposals for trends and patterns in order to better deal with SmallSAT projects, centered at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. Currently I'm an assistant researcher for [Professor Giulia Guidi](https://giuliaguidi.github.io/) working on GPUs in HPC applications.

In my free time I'm a member of the big red marching and pep bands. I love running, swimming, climbing, and almost anything athletic. If you have a good book, feel free to send it to me, I love a good story.
